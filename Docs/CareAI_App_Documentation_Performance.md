## Key Performance Enhancements
The following optimizations ensure that the app runs efficiently across a variety of mobile devices, especially those used by seniors with limited system resources.

# CareAI - Performance Optimization Report

## ‚úÖ Overview
This report documents all major performance enhancements implemented to ensure CareAI is optimized for real-world usage ‚Äî particularly for senior users on battery-limited or accessibility-prioritized devices.

---

## üîã Battery Saver Mode

- **Hook:** `useSettings`
- **Features Disabled When Active:**
  - High-frequency voice feedback
  - Haptic vibration (non-essential)
  - Animations and transitions (reduced motion)
- **Fallback Mode:** Delays speech playback and minimizes background refresh

---

## üó£Ô∏è Smart Voice Playback

- **Hook:** `useVoiceFeedback`
- **Features:**
  - Priority-based message queue
  - Delayed playback between messages
  - Duplicate suppression per session
  - Voice state tracking to avoid overlap

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lazy Component Loading

- **Implementation:**
  - Used `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for heavier screens
  - Loaded only when needed (e.g. `AnalyticsScreen`, `TransitionHistoryScreen`)
- **Result:** Reduced bundle size and improved app launch time

---

## üîÅ Passive Data Sync

- **Hook:** `useFocusEffect` + background interval checks (6 hrs)
- **Behavior:**
  - Data loads only on screen focus or after interval expiration
  - Background sync cleans up expired reminders/alerts

---

## üßπ Memory and Event Cleanup

- **Implementation:**
  - `useEffect` cleanup for all side effects
  - Speech buffers, timeouts, intervals cleared correctly
  - Navigation listeners removed on unmount

---

## üßæ Virtualized Lists

- **Component:** `VirtualizedList`
- **Enhancements:**
  - Optimized props (`initialNumToRender`, `windowSize`)
  - `getItemLayout` used where possible
  - Reduces memory on large screens like Reminders or Claims

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Optimization

- Integrated with all enhancements:
  - Screen reader feedback syncs with voice
  - Focus indicators adjusted for screen magnification
  - Reduced motion mode respected for animations
  - Speech batching aids users with low cognitive stamina

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Recommendations

### Battery Impact
- Enable reminders, voice feedback, and speech queue
- Use real device for 1 hour with and without battery saver

### Accessibility
- Navigate app using screen reader (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- Confirm all feedback is spoken once only
- Test large font scaling

### Notifications
- Schedule multiple reminders
- Verify voice playback when app is foregrounded

### Offline Mode
- Use airplane mode and retry navigating and syncing

---

## üí° Summary
The CareAI app is optimized for low-battery devices, voice-first interaction, and graceful handling of missed or long-delayed feedback. These changes prepare us for real-world testing and app store submission.
